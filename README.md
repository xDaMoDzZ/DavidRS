## Will you teach anything besides backend?

Yes. For now, we're still focused on having the absolute best curriculum and platform for budding backend developers. And we're prioritizing making it available in more languages, but we plan to then branch out to other career goals. Likely next candidates include:

1. Data Engineering
2. DevOps / Infrastructure
3. Embedded
4. Game Dev
5. Cyber Security
6. Front End (lol jk)

## Should I start learning even though the program is not "complete"?

**Yes you should get started - this program will always be improving and never be "complete".** This curriculum will never be "complete" in the same sense the YouTube will never be "complete" - there is new content all the time. We care deeply about the quality of this program and will always be improving and adding to it.
